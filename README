The task is to create an app that replaces a facial expression with an emodji

At this stage two databases are used: 
    --- The Extended Cohn-Kanade Dataset (CK+) and can be found at http://www.consortium.ri.cmu.edu/ckagree/. 
    --- The Japanese Female Facial Expression (JAFFE). JAFFE can be found here: http://www.kasrl.org/jaffe.html
