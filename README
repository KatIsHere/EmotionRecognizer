The task is to create an app that replaces a facial expression with an emodji

At this stage two databases are used: 
    --- The Extended Cohn-Kanade Dataset (CK+) and can be found at http://www.consortium.ri.cmu.edu/ckagree/. 
    --- The Japanese Female Facial Expression (JAFFE). JAFFE can be found here: http://www.kasrl.org/jaffe.html
    --- http://app.visgraf.impa.br/database/faces/ - faces database


Dataset description
    Every dataset has been pre-processed and saved in a corresponding .csv file with table structure:
            file_path   |   img_label   |   bounding box (x0, y0, x1, y1)   |   normed bounding box (x0, y0, x1, y1)
    There was some confusion if the cnn should recognize contempt, so in .csv files 
    with number 8 in a name contempt labels are: 
    
    0 : neutral, 1 : anger, 2 : contempt, 3 : disgust, 4 : fear, 5 : happy, 6 : sadness, 7 : surprise 
    
    In files withought 8 in the labele correspondance is: 
    
    0 : neutral, 1 : anger, 2 : disgust, 3 : fear, 4 : happy, 5 : sadness, 6 : surprise
